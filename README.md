# Automation_SeqDetector_Verilog
This repository contains an automated Finite State Machine (FSM) generator and Verilog implementation for sequence detectors. Given any binary sequence (e.g., 1011), the automation script generates the corresponding Verilog RTL code and testbench, enabling quick design and simulation of custom sequence detectors.
